# BoopTheSnoot
------------------------------------------------
The project is about having a dog nose pointed at your mouse cursor wherever you put it in the window

If it's still not clear, check out pointerpointer.com because that was where I got my inspiration from

Just a fun project I did when I had some time 

Very bad code behind the scene, I'll refine it in next version
**************************************************************
ImageClassifier.py is for finding dogs' nose and store them in snoot.txt

Launcher.py is the main script

# AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
